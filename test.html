  <h1>Try to "Match the Hatch"</h1>
  <p>
    As you are fishing you routinely examine the water to see what kinds of bugs the trout are feeding on.
    Any good fisherman knows that you'll catch a lot more fish if you can match your flies to the bugs in the water.
    <br>
    A random bug image will appear below. Try to click the fly that best matches the bug.
    If you do you'll start catching fish! You have ten good holes to try on the river.
